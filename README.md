The Fear Of Death is a Horror Game, where is a monster walking around the map, and if the player is close to him, then the monster starts chasing till player is far from him. 
If player gets caught, the game will end with a jumpscare. 
To win the game, player needs to find the book with red light, and open the blue door on the house with the key, then go to the portal in the room. 
The book is located near the player now so it will be easier to test the game. And the blue door to open is located at the second floor of the white house which is front of the player when the game starts.

The blue plus signs are a feature to save the players location at that point when game will be restarted when player collects them.

Note: Maybe some features can't work in the game because of the WebGL format.
The game may not should be look very great cosmeticly. I focused more to make many features work.
